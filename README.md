rxTools is a collection of hacking tools for Nintendo 3DS/3DSXL/2DS, compatible with all the system versions from 4.1 to 9.2.

rxMode is a free custom firmware which works through rxTools, not meant to replace any existing software, but just my personal
work made public and easy for the end-user.

It was not meant, at the beginning, to be open-source, so you can expect some messed up code here.

I do not support piracy in any way, all the data and information in my software have already been made public.

## Current functionality
### General
- Support for Web Browser (SPIDER) entrypoint for Old 3DS (ver 4.1-9.2)
- Support for System Settings (MSET) entrypoint for Old 3DS (ver 4.1-4.5, 6.0-6.4, and 9.2 with MSET downgraded to 6.x)
- Support for System Settings (MSET) downgrading for Old 3DS
- Support for Ninjhax (Not Stable)
- Hacking tools collection

### rxMode
- Support for the latest emuNAND version on Old 3DS and New 3DS (you currently need key_0x16.bin and key_0x1B.bin for N3DS)
- Support for sysNAND, in case an emuNAND is not found
- Access to the eShop and to online playing (requires an updated emuNAND)
- Support for 100% of the games (newer ones will require emuNAND)
- Signatures Checks disabled, which should allow just homebrew, but the world is cruel...
- Support for installing FBI (a CIA Manager) in both emuNAND and sysNAND
- Support for AGB (GBA Virtual Console) on both sysNAND and emuNAND on Old 3DS
- Support for TWL (DS/DSi cartridges and DSiWare) **only on sysNAND**
- Dynamic RAM dumping (just for debug purposes)

## Nightlies
Nightly builds of rxTools are a thing, again! :D https://lavanoid.github.io/


## How to build
Requires ImageMagick >= 6.8.9 - If you are using Ubuntu 14.04 or below, do not use the version in the official repositories, as it is outdated

Requirements for Windows:
- git, clone this repository with the following command: *git  clone --recursive https://github.com/roxas75/rxTools.git*
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org)
- [devkitPRO](http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro) with devkitARM option and suboptions installed (in case make.exe fails with stack trace dump, install [GnuWin Make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net) and place it in path before devkitPRO/msys/bin)
- GCC (for Windows [MinGW](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw) with mingw32-base will be fine)
- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org)

Requirements for GNU/Linux:
- [git](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/git/), clone this repository with the following command: *git  clone --recursive https://github.com/roxas75/rxTools.git*
- [devkitPRO and devkitARM](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment) (follow the tutorial for Linux)
- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) (on Debian/Ubuntu, [install it using apt](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/imagemagick/))

Just run **make release** and rxTools/sys directory should be generated in the **release** folder, along with all the other packets, then copy the contents of the release folder to the root of your SD card.  

If you get the *make: Interrupt/Exception caught (code = 0xc00000fd, addr = 0x4227d3)* error on Windows, look at your PATH and move any path with parenthesis to the end of it

Make sure that the path to rxTools doesn't include space (' ').

## Setting up rxTools  
- If you have used a previous version, please delete SD:/rxTools, SD:/3ds/rxTools, and rxTools.dat, if present on your (m)SD card.  
- Extract the rxTools folder from the release and place it into the root of your card.
- If you are using an Old 3DS or 2DS, ensure you have Python 2.7 installed on your PC and run /Tools/o3ds_cdn_firm.py. This should download 3 files into a folder named /firm. Copy this entire folder and place it into SD:/rxTools/.
- If you are using an New 3DS, ensure you have Python 2.7 installed on your PC and run /Tools/n3ds_cdn_firm.py. This should download 1 file into a folder named /firm. Copy this entire folder and place it into SD:/rxTools/. You also need the files key_0x16.bin (N3DS arm9bin decryption, 9.6+ keyX) and key_0x1B.bin (N3DS 9.6 NCCH keyX) on the root of your SD card.
- For use with the Homebrew Launcher, go into the ninjhax folder and copy the /rxTools folder to SD:/3ds/  
  


## How to launch with Spider
rxTools *now* stores its code.bin in rxTools/sys/code.bin (formerly /rxTools.dat). To launch rxTools using the Spider exploit visit https://dukesrg.github.io/?rxTools/sys/code.bin using the 3DS Internet Browser. (Requires ver 9.2 or older).

## How to install DS Profile (MSET) Exploit (requires MSET 6.x)
Upon building, there will be a folder called release/mset that contains the files rxinstaller.nds and rxinstaller.bin. Using a supported NDS flash cart, launch rxinstaller.nds to install the MSET exploit. Otherwise, on firmwares 9.2 or older, copy rxinstaller.bin (take it in release/mset/) to SD:/mset/, and visit https://dukesrg.github.io/?mset/rxinstaller.bin to install the MSET exploit via the Spider exploit. If it worked, you'll see the bottom screen flash, and then the browser will appear to continue functioning normally. Press the home button, and after you see the Home Menu splash screen your DS will say "an error occurred" and ask you to reboot, but it's already done. You can then launch rxTools by going to Settings -> Profile -> DS Profile Settings.
Alternatively, you can install the MSET ROP with FBI. Press select and use left and right on the D-pad to select "rxTools3.x 4.x" or "rxTools3.x 6.x", depending on the version of MSET you are using. 
* Do NOT install 4.x MSET on a 2ds. Formatting in this configuration will cause a soft brick!
