CREDITS TO RikuKH3

All the files available in this directory were generated by the 3DS FBI CIA Manager NAND Inject Generator created by RikuKH3.

This will substitute the 'Health&Safety Information' app in your emuNAND or sysNAND with FBI (the currently most common CIA Manager).

In order to inject FBI to your Health & Safety application:

1. First run rxTools and go to Other Options -> Install FBI over Health&Safety App. It will say an error ocurred; don't worry, that's normal.

2. Take note of the console region and the TMD version, and turn off your 3DS.

3. Open the "fbi_injection/[region]/[version]" folder and copy the "fbi_inject.app" and "fbi_inject.tmd" files to the SD card root dir.

4. Run rxTools and go to Other Options -> Install FBI over Health&Safety App.

5. Enjoy.
